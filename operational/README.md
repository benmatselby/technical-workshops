# Operational

**Time allocation:** 30 minutes

This workshop aims to take a peek at the future, and talk about what life will be like, when we are supporting our services. We will cover off how we are supporting the Jenkins solution, what tooling we have built, and how we use the monitoring solution. This is aimed at any engineer who works on EMIS-X and will be supporting their services.
