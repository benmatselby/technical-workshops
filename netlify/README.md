# Jenkins application overview

**Time allocation:** 45 minutes

This workshop aims to provide an overview of Netlify. We will get you up and running with a simple web application deploying into Netlify. We will cover things like the CLI and Functions. If you're wanting to ditch managing in infrastructure for your web applications, then this is the workshop for you.

We have a rough agenda of:

- What is Netlify?
- What the benefits are.
- The dashboard
- Logs
- The CLI
- The configuration
- The deployments
  - Deploy previews.
  - Branch based deployments.
  - Publish a deployment.
  - Back out a deployment.
- Q&A
