# Contributing to the Jenkins solution

**Time allocation:** 30 minutes

This was last run on 15th February 2021 and 30 people attended.

This workshop aims to provide insights as to how the community can engage with this project. For example, defining build environments that teams can use. If you want to help support a language or tool, this workshop is perfect for you.

Items we'll go over (but potentially not exhaustive) are:

- Extending the environments that we offer
- Making more agents available to your instance
- Adding views to your `jenkins.yaml` to ensure persistence
- Adding deploy roles to your instance
- Requesting SSO access to an instance
- Go over [this documentation](https://github.com/emisgroup/jenkins-infrastructure/wiki/Environments-and-tools).
